Prinsip penting untuk instalasi publik:

- ``safe``: memory percakapan + baca skill. Cocok untuk Telegram/WA/webhook.
- ``workspace``: safe + file read/write terbatas di workspace pemilik.
- ``full``: workspace + shell. Hanya default untuk CLI lokal pemilik.

Gateway publik *tidak pernah* mendapat shell/file tools tanpa owner secara

class ToolRisk:
    """Risk classes for native tools.

    Every native tool carries exactly one class, chosen for its most
    privileged capability ("when in doubt, stricter"): a tool that *can*
    delete is Destructive even if it usually only reads.

    Risk is judged by *effect*, not by channel: a GET over the network has
    the same effect as reading a local file (none), while a POST that sends
    a message has an effect no local read can produce. That is why the
    network classes split on mutation, not on "uses the network":

    - ``READ``: no side effects. A pure read-only network fetch (web search,
      page fetch, a transcription/vision inference call against the
      already-trusted provider) is a READ — the effect is a read, even
      though bytes cross the network. Never asks.
    - ``WRITE``: mutates local state (files, memory, task board, skills).
      Asks only when the write escapes the session workspace. A download
      (GET + workspace write) is a WRITE: the network leg is a read, the
      effect is a local file.
    - ``NETWORK``: a network call that *mutates* — it sends data out to
      change state somewhere else (sending a message/email, uploading a
      file, posting a comment, calling a state-changing API). Always asks,
      because the channel crossing is the point of no return: the operator
      cannot undo a send.
    - ``INSTALL``: installs something persistent — software via shell aside,
      here: scheduled jobs, proxy routes, agent skills. Always asks.
    - ``DESTRUCTIVE``: can irreversibly destroy data (arbitrary code/shell
      trivially can), or performs network mutations too broad to scope
      (raw HTTP with any method incl. DELETE, full browser control).
      Always asks. Scoped, single-purpose sends (one email, one comment,
      one issue) are ``NETWORK`` instead — still asking, but labelled by
      their actual effect.

    Non-native tools (MCP ``mcp__*``, custom ``custom_*``, OpenAPI ``api_*``)
    are not classified per tool: anything not explicitly trusted by the
    operator in the config file defaults to ``DESTRUCTIVE`` (fail closed —
    a tool whose effects we cannot audit must never run silently). A per-MCP-
    server ``trust.risk_cap`` in the config file can lower that default, and
    only from the config file, never from chat.

    Approval is enforced by the agent loop through the ``ask_user`` picker:
    Install/Destructive/Network calls, and Write calls that escape the
    workspace, do not run on the model's authority alone. The legacy
    ``SAFE_PROFILES`` are unchanged and still gate *visibility*:

    - ``safe`` (public gateways): Read tools plus scoped in-profile writes
      (memory); the odd dangerous tool exposed here (``http_request``)
      still asks first — visibility never implies trust.
    - ``workspace``: safe + Read/Write inside the operator workspace; a
      Write that escapes the workspace triggers approval.
    - ``full``: everything, including Install/Destructive/Network — each
      dangerous call asks first. Default only for the owner's local CLI.

    grant is also auditable: ``schedule_task show`` prints exactly what the
    job may do, and the operator approved that list once, explicitly.

    Why denial is loud instead of fail-open: a silently skipped tool reads
    as a successful run that did nothing, and the operator only notices
    weeks later. Every denial is recorded on ``self.denials`` and the
    scheduler appends it to the job's ``last_status``, so ``cron list``
    shows what was blocked and why.

    Grants are snapshotted when the run starts (``from_job`` copies the
    declaration into this object): editing jobs.json mid-run cannot change
    what the running turn may do — no TOCTOU inside a run. The next run
    picks up the edited grants.

    Omitting BOTH constructor args gives the default minimal grants (read +
    workspace-confined write) — the same floor ``add_job`` uses. Partial
    omission does NOT: ``GrantApprovalPolicy(tools=[...])`` alone grants only
    the named tools with NO risk classes, and vice versa — the omitted side
    falls back to empty, not to the default. Pass ``from_job`` — or both args

          fetch — risk is the effect, not the channel).

          different declaration asks again.

        - Denials are NOT audit-logged: the audit trail records side effects,
          and a denied call has none. (Cron denials are recorded loudly on
          the grant policy instead, and surface in the job's last_status.)
