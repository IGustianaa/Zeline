"""Human-in-the-loop: let a tool ask the operator a question mid-turn.

The agent runs its turn on a worker thread while the gateway keeps polling, so
a tool can block on a question and the reply arrives through the normal message
path. This module is the meeting point between the two.

Flow:

1. ``ask_user`` (tool) calls :func:`ask`, which registers a pending question for
   that session identity and blocks on an event.
2. The gateway sees a pending question via :func:`pending` and renders it
   (Telegram inline keyboard, CLI prompt, ...). The user's next message — or a
   button tap — is routed to :func:`answer` instead of starting a new turn.
3. :func:`ask` wakes up and returns the answer to the model.

Design rules learned from the ``/stop`` work:

- A blocking wait MUST be cancellable. ``/stop`` and ``/new`` call
  :func:`cancel` so a pending question never wedges a session.
- The wait MUST have a ceiling below ``config.MAX_TURN_SECONDS``; otherwise the
  turn budget expires while a tool sits waiting and the user sees nothing.
- Only ONE question per identity may be open at a time. A second question
  replaces nothing — it is refused, so the model cannot spam prompts.
